# what this does?
calls an api to get the IPv4, with this, it search this IP on [thpsxdata.com](https://thpsxdata.com/stats/newestStats/statsfull2.txt), it also search the hostname from this IP. 
after saving the hostname, it searches this hostname in [openspy api](http://beta.openspy.net/api/servers/thugpro), here is where it grabs the other info (gamemode, mapname, etc)

# what this doesn't do?

- [ ] only load if user has thugpro open
